title: Model Analysis 1

# Model Analysis 1 with Simon Širca and Miha Mihovilovič
This page is a **Work in Progress**. I have yet to finish this subject! However I have submitted reports
which you can find below along with their respective code.

Model Analysis is the bigger brother to Mathematical Physics Practicum from the bachelor's studies. It is a
course that is meant to teach us how to model physical systems and analyze them. I went into this course very
excited only to experience quite a bit of disappointment due to my misguided expectations. I thought this course way very *computation* centric as it is the primary course for the Computational Physics specialization. However, it is more about exploring various physical models, their properties and the methods used to analyze them. This is not a bad thing, however it took my stubborn brain a while to understand that this is not a course about programming but about physics.

Despite my initial disappointment, I really appreciate the course and I whole-heartedly recommend it to everyone since no matter what you do in the future, this knowledge will be applicable. Just keep the course focus in mind. I'd also like to mention that the tasks in the course are graded as $8$ if everything in the instructions is done correctly. Grades above $8$ are reserved for additional work and creativity.
